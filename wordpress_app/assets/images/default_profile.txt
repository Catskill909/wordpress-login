We need to create a default_profile.png file in this directory.

Since I can't directly create binary files like PNG through the text interface, you'll need to:

1. Find or create a simple profile placeholder image (a silhouette or avatar icon)
2. Save it as "default_profile.png" in this directory (wordpress_app/assets/images/)
3. Make sure it's around 200x200 pixels for good quality without being too large

Once you've added the image, you can delete this text file.
